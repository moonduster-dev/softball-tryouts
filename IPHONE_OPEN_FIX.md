If Safari isn't showing up as an option when you try to open the file, use one of these methods:

---

2. **Tap the Share button** (box with arrow pointing up) at the top
3. **Scroll down and look for "Safari"** in the list of apps
4. **Tap Safari** - the file will open in Safari!

---

## ✅ METHOD 2: Long Press the File

1. **In Files app, LONG PRESS** (tap and hold) on the file
2. **Tap "Share"** from the menu that pops up
3. **Look for Safari** in the share sheet
4. **Tap Safari** to open

## ✅ METHOD 3: Open from Email Directly (BEST!)

**Don't save to Files at all!**

1. **Open the email** with the index.html attachment
2. **TAP the attachment** - it will preview
3. **Tap the Share button** (box with arrow up) in the top right
4. **Select "Safari"** from the share options
5. File opens in Safari - **now bookmark it!** (Share → Add Bookmark)

## ✅ METHOD 4: Use AirDrop to Yourself

If Safari still doesn't show up:

1. **In Files app, long press the file**
2. **Tap "Share"**
3. **Select "AirDrop"**
4. **Send to yourself** (your iPhone should appear)
5. **Tap to accept** - it should open in Safari

## ✅ METHOD 5: Copy and Open Safari Manually

1. **Open Safari browser first**
2. **Tap the tabs button** (bottom right)
3. **Tap the + for new tab**
4. **In the address bar, type:** `file://`
5. This might not work well, so use Method 1 or 3 instead

## 🏠 AFTER YOU GET IT OPEN: Add to Home Screen!

Once you have the file open in Safari:

1. **Tap the Share button** (box with arrow)
2. **Scroll down** and tap **"Add to Home Screen"**
3. **Name it** (like "Tryout Scorer")
4. **Tap "Add"**

Now you have an icon on your home screen - just tap it to open the app instantly! No need to find the file in Files app anymore.

## 💡 PRO TIP: Keep the Email!

The **easiest method** is Method 3 - opening directly from the email attachment. Keep the email in your inbox so you can always access the file quickly!

## ❓ Still Not Working?

**Make sure you have Safari installed:**
- Safari comes pre-installed on iPhone
- Check if it's in your app library
- If you deleted it, reinstall from App Store

**Try Chrome instead:**
1. Install Chrome from App Store (if not already installed)
2. Follow Method 1 or 3 above
3. Look for "Chrome" instead of "Safari" in the share sheet

**Last resort - Forward the email:**
1. Forward the email to yourself
2. Open the new email
3. Tap the attachment to preview
4. Tap Share → Safari
