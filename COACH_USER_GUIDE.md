## How Scoring Works

### Automatic Calculations
- **Timed events** (Pop Time, runs, Pro Agility): The system **averages all attempts** and converts to a 1-5 score
- **Broad Jump**: **Average** distance of attempts is converted to a 1-5 score
- **Coach-averaged scores**: Scrimmage and Intangibles average all coaches' scores

### Score Thresholds

**Pop Time (seconds):**
- 5 pts: ≤2.3s | 4 pts: ≤2.5s | 3 pts: ≤2.7s | 2 pts: ≤3.0s | 1 pt: >3.0s

**H→1B (seconds):**
- 5 pts: ≤3.1s | 4 pts: ≤3.8s | 3 pts: ≤4.6s | 2 pts: ≤5.2s | 1 pt: >5.2s

**Broad Jump (feet):**
- 5 pts: ≥7ft | 4 pts: ≥6ft | 3 pts: ≥5ft | 2 pts: ≥4ft | 1 pt: <4ft

## Data Syncing

- All scores **automatically save** to Google Sheets
- Changes sync within 1 second of entering data
- You'll see the last sync time at the top of the screen
- Multiple coaches can score simultaneously - data merges automatically

---

## Tips

1. **Score as you go** - Don't wait until the end; data saves automatically
2. **Use notes** for observations that don't fit in scores (attitude, coachability, etc.)
3. **Check the sync indicator** to make sure your data is saving
4. **Generate reports** at the end of tryouts to review all players ranked by score

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Can't log in | Make sure password is exactly `nick2026` |
| Data not saving | Check your internet connection; look for sync indicator |
| Can't see other coaches' scores | Refresh the page to pull latest data |
| Report shows "N/A" | That metric hasn't been scored yet |
